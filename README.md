📊 Project 1: Patient Health Risk Analysis (Python )

🔹 Project Overview

This project analyzes patient health data to identify individuals who are at risk of heart disease and other medical conditions using Python and data visualization tools.

🔹 Tools Used

•	Python (Pandas, NumPy, Plotly, Matplotlib)

•	Power BI

•	Excel (for initial data handling)

🔹 What I Did

•	Cleaned missing and inconsistent data using Pandas

•	Created new features like:

•	Age Group categorization

•	BMI Category

•	Lifestyle Risk Score

•	Metabolic Risk Score

•	Cardiac Risk Score

•	Used data visualization to understand:

•	Risk distribution by age

•	BMI vs Cholesterol impact

•	High-risk patient identification

•	Built an interactive Power BI dashboard to display:

•	Risk trends

•	High-risk patient segments

•	Health metrics comparison

🔹 Key Insights

•	Patients above 50 with high cholesterol and high BP show higher cardiac risk.

•	Smoking and obesity significantly increase health risk.

•	Early identification helps in preventive care.

🔹 Outcome
•	This project demonstrates how data analytics can help in early risk detection and healthcare decision-making.
